# pisugar_tray
Used the PiJuice tray as a base and updated to work with pisugar https://github.com/PiSupply/PiJuice

Adds a tray icon with the battery percentage and shows if it is charging.

Add the pisugar_tray.desktop file in your home directory/.config/autostart/ to have the tray icon start when you login.
